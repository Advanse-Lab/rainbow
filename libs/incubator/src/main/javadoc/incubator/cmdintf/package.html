<p>
The <cmd>cmdintf</cmd> package a command-line interface that allows users to
input commands and the system to process those commands. Commands can be
easily added with this package. 
</p>

<p>
There are three main concepts in the package: a command, a command interface and
a command manager. A command is a general executable operation which can be
invoked by the user. A command interface is an adapter for a text-based user
interaction. A command manager glues the two concepts together: it contains a
list of all commands that can be executed and reads commands from command
interfaces.
</p>

<p>
The highest level layer is comprised of the <code>CommandInterface</code>
interface, the <code>Command</code> interface and the
<code>CommandManager</code> class. These represent the most general contracts
but, in general, more concrete ones will be used.
</p>

<p>
Since command interfaces are text-based, a concrete implementation based on
IO streams is provided in the <code>StreamCommandInterface</code> class. A
subclass of this class exists, the <code>SocketStreamCommandInterface</code>
class, which contains the particular case in which the streams derive from a
network socket.
</p>

<p>
In general commands will not implement directly the <code>Command</code>
interface but will rather extend the <code>AbstractCommmand</code> class. This
class already does part of the work and helps avoiding multi-threading issues.
</p>

<p>
The <code>CommandManager</code> does not define how command interfaces are
created. A specific subclass, <code>ServerSocketCommandManager</code> will
create a server socket and accept incoming connections creating
<code>SocketStreamCommandInterface</code> interfaces for each incoming client.
</p>

<p>
Upon creation, the <code>CommandManager</code> creates two commands: the
<code>HelpCommand</code> (which displays help for all commands) and the
<code>CloseCommand</code> which closes the connection.
</p>

<p>
Each time a client connects, the <code>CommandManager</code> will start a new
session. Each session is identified by a single ID. The command manager keeps
track of all sessions active and all closed sessions.
