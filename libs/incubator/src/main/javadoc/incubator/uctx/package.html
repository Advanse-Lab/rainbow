       Introduction and concepts 
    </h1>
    <p>
       The <code>uctx</code> package defines the concept of a <em>user
context</em>. A user context (or <em>uctx</em> for brevity) represents a set of
data which is current accessible to the user (the data is in the user's context
-- hence the name). This concept forms a basis for user interface application in
which users manipulate data in certain contexts. 
    </p>
    <p>
       For instance, consider an invoice managing application with the user
interface depicted below. The invoice
screen contains a list of invoices in the left table and, in the right part of
the screen, details of the invoice and a
list of items of the currently selected invoice. There are three possible
actions in the screen: print the list of invoices, print the details of the
invoice and print the list of items in the invoice, all labeled "print".
    </p>

<p>Purposely, all buttons are labeled "print". However, for a user, it is
clear which of the print actions each button refers to. (Tt is not under
discussion how friendly the user interface is!) If all buttons have the same
label, why is the user able to distinguish them?</p>

<p>The concept that distinguishes the buttons is the concept of
<em>context</em>. The context (or <em>user context</em> to be more precise,
which will be abreviated to <em>uctx</em> in this documentation) represents
the set of data currently available to the user. And, due to the visual
disposition of the user interface, each action is associated to a different
part of the context. The print button near the invoice list is associated
with the invoice list, the one near the form is associated with the form and
the one near the item list is associated with the item list.</p>

<p>But it is not only the buttons that are associated with context. A user
would expect from any standard GUI application that whenever the selection
of the invoice on the list changes, the data on the form and item list would
change accordingly. This means that the data on certain parts of the uctx
(the invoice detail and item list) are dependent on other parts of the context
(the selection in the current invoice list).</p>

<p>Using the uctx concept the list of invoices is part of the context. The
table showing the invoice list is dependent upon this part of the context
and so is the print action which prints all invoices.</p>

<p>The currently selected
invoice is also part of the context. Whenever the user changes the currently
selected invoice, that part of the context changes. Since the invoice detail
s and item list are dependent on that context part, they will update
automatically. So will the print actions.</p>

<p>The uctx, therefore, brings to GUI construction the metaphore of indirect
invocation with the inherent decoupling and increased maintainability.</p>

<h1>Hierarchical contexts</h1>

<p>
Contexts can be defined hierarchically. If a context is a child of another
context, then all the parent's content is available to the child. Context
elements with the same name override the parent's value (if the parent is
directly queried, however, its own value is returned).
</p>

<p>
The context hierarchy is established dynamically. Cyclic hierarchies are not
allowed.
