/**
<p>Structures are complex data types organized in an acyclic graph (also
known as a hierarchy with multiple inheritance). Structures types define fields
which, in structure values, refer to instances of types.</p>

<p>Structures are similar to the C concept of <code>struct</code> with the
addition of multiple inheritance support. Structures may be abstract:
abstract structures cannot be instantiated but they may be super types of
structures which are not abstract.</p>
